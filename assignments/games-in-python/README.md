### 🛠️ Build the Hangman Game

#### Description
Write a Hangman game that allows players to guess letters one at a time. The game should randomly select a word from a predefined list, track the player's guesses, and display the game state after each guess. The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses from the player
- Display current progress using underscores for unrevealed letters (e.g., _ _ _)
- Track the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display appropriate win or lose messages
